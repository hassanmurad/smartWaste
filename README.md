This project is a proof-of-concept for a trash bin that recognizes the item according to its category using voice recognition. It combines two arduinos (1 as a master - voice recognition and the 2nd as a slave - actuating motors & LED's'). An android App was also developed that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the capcity of the bin and relay it to the App in real-time using a bluetooh module. 

Enjoy!
